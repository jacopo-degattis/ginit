## Description
Create github repo remotely on github.
When you want to create a new repository on github, you don't need anymore to get on the github.com website.
You can easily launch this utility with the command:

```bash
$ ./gget.rb <repo_name>
```

And then do the usual stuff, like branch, add, commit and push !
